# Girls Nest

Women have always been at the center of the society, they are the unsung heroes in every family. While they are seen as one of the people at the forefront, 
they have been affected by various problems ranging from sexual harassment to more advanced form of domestic violence or gender based violence. Most of them have lost the hold of their voices, by this we mean they have no one to talk to, cry to, not even empathise with them and more often than not, they are usually shy to speak up. Our greatest concern is the fact that most women in underdeveloped societies are illetrates. They serve as a trade off. This have led to lack of women who can participate fully in the society and a shrinkage in skills. 
The workforce is not balanced. 

During the covid 19 pandemic, there was a trend, "Justice for Uwa" on the social media. Uwa was a teenager who was raped. 
She couldn't contain the feeling that she was raped by three men and died at the end of the day. 
A lot of women go through problems that weight more than this and this has led to depression, mental stress and so many more. 

There are organization focused on solving problems for the girl child but it's not enough and that's where Girls Nest comes in.

Girls Nest is an organization focused on helping females who have been affected sexually and mentally. We help them speak out, know how to handle these problems and also get all the support they need. 


## Case study
Meet Adesua, a 22 years old lady who went to a chapel at night to pray but ended up being raped by two men. 
She could not survive it because her voice was absorbed by the rain and no one could save her. A girl with so much dreams lost her life just like that and left her family shattered.
